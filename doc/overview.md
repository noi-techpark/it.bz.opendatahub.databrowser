## 1. Project Overview

### **Goal**

The primary goals of the project are to enable convenient access to Open Data Hub data, prioritize user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) enhancements, facilitate straightforward data discoveries by offering dataset overviews and filtering options. Additionally, the project aims to ensure the databrowser's configurability, allowing customization according to specific needs, and provide a dedicated tool for developers to streamline their workflow and interaction with the data.

### **Visualization**

- **List or Table view** <br>
  The table view allows users to easily browse and analyze the dataset by visually organizing the data in a grid-like structure. It provides a clear and concise representation of the data, displaying multiple records and their corresponding attributes simultaneously. The table view includes sorting and filtering options, allowing users to rearrange and refine the displayed data based on specific criteria.
- **Raw view** <br>
  The raw view presents the JSON file representation of a single record.
- **Detail view** <br>
  The detail provides an in-depth and comprehensive representation of a single record. It allows users to examine a specific record in detail, displaying all available attributes and associated information in a focused and structured manner.
- **Edit view** <br>
  The edit view enables authorized users to modify the attributes of a single record. They can do so in the detail view interface where users can edit the existing values or input new values for the different attributes associated with the record.
- **Quick view** <br>
  The quick view is a user-friendly interface that provides a concise and summary-based overview of a record, highlighting the most important attributes. It aims to present key information in a visually appealing and easily digestible format.

## 2. Project Main technologies

The databrowser leverages the following technologies:

- **Vue.js:** A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js allows for efficient component-based development, reactivity, and seamless integration with other libraries or existing projects.
  Learn more about [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience by providing type checking and improved code maintainability. TypeScript enables better collaboration and reduces runtime errors.
  Learn more about [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with pre-defined classes. Tailwind CSS offers a highly customizable and responsive design system, allowing developers to create modern and consistent user interfaces efficiently.
  Learn more about [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

- **Husky:** A Git hook manager that enables running scripts automatically before committing or pushing code. Husky helps maintain code quality by performing checks such as linting, testing, and code formatting.
  Learn more about [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/).

- **Reuse:** A tool for generating software licenses and copyright headers for your project's source code files. Reuse simplifies license management and ensures compliance with open-source licensing requirements.
