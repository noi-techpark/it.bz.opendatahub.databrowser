## 1. Project Overview

The databrowser leverages the following technologies:

- **Vue.js:** A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js allows for efficient component-based development, reactivity, and seamless integration with other libraries or existing projects.
  Learn more about [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience by providing type checking and improved code maintainability. TypeScript enables better collaboration and reduces runtime errors.
  Learn more about [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with pre-defined classes. Tailwind CSS offers a highly customizable and responsive design system, allowing developers to create modern and consistent user interfaces efficiently.
  Learn more about [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

- **Husky:** A Git hook manager that enables running scripts automatically before committing or pushing code. Husky helps maintain code quality by performing checks such as linting, testing, and code formatting.
  Learn more about [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/).

- **Reuse:** A tool for generating software licenses and copyright headers for your project's source code files. Reuse simplifies license management and ensures compliance with open-source licensing requirements.
